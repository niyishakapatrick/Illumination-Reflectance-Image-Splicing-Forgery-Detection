Illumination-Reflectance Image Splicing Forgery Detection

Image splicing introduces  illumination inconsistencies in the new composite image. To expose traces of tampering in composite image, we proposed an efficient Image Splicing Forgery Detection algorithm based on illumination-reflectance model and bilateral edge-preserved filter. Experimental results showed that our algorithm can greatly distinguish authentic images from tampered images.
